# How t get your Line token
You can generate your own personal tokens by navigating to  https://notify-bot.line.me/en/ (LINE account required).

When you click the “Generate token” button, you will see a screen where you can name your token and select a target that you will send messages to when the token is used.

Use an easily recognizable name for your token. When selecting message targets, selecting “1-on-1 chat with LINE Notify” will make the LINE Notify official account send a message to you.
